#Setup

Assuming a linux OS with pyenv installed, the bash commands to setup a python virtual environment with the required dependencies can be found in install\_deps.sh.

Furthermore, the required competition data needs to be moved into the raw\_data folder. This data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). For example, the training data should be located at "raw\_data/train.csv" (relative to the base directory).
